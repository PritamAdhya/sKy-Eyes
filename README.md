Hey there! Welcome to my Weather App UX/UI design repository.

This design showcases a sleek interface divided into four frames:

1. Frame 1: Features the app logo for easy recognition.
2. Frame 2: Displays default weather statuses of main cities with horizontal scrolling and a search option.
3. Frame 3: Continues city names with horizontal scrolling for seamless exploration.
4. Frame 4: Provides detailed weather data for the entered city.

I have prioritized user experience, aiming for intuitive navigation and a clean layout to access weather information effortlessly. My design is making weather updates easy and accessible for all users.

Feel free to explore and contribute! Your feedback is highly appreciated. ðŸš€
